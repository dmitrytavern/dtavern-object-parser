Writing an implementation of object validation every time is depressing. Or working with the API of a third-party service over which there is no control. If the service changes its API, the problem will be difficult to detect immediately, especially if there are many such projects and there is simply no time to work simultaneously.</p><p>And, since I&#39;ve had several commercial projects on Vue.js, I really liked the implementation of &quot;props&quot; in this framework. In my opinion, this implementation is much better than PropTypes in React.js.</p><p>Therefore, I decided to write my own implementation of Vue props, which could work in any conditions.</p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>ObjectParser has the following features:</p><ul><li><strong>Ligth-weight</strong>. ~7KiB in compressed without gzip and ~3KiB with.</li><li><strong>Vue-like props</strong>. Write schemas like Vue.js props.</li><li><strong>Powerful property checker</strong>.
