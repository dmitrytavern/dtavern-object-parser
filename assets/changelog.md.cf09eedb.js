However, almost everything had to be rewritten in the process. From new:</p><ul><li><strong>Updated public API</strong> - core functions have been added for schema generation and asynchronous parsing, and the old main function has been changed. Utilities for specific use have also been added.</li><li><strong>Add support nested objects</strong> - a new way of creating schemas, as well as a modified parsing algorithm, made it possible to parse nested objects.</li><li><strong>Improve typescript support</strong> - more complex typing now allows you to determine the type of an object and its properties by schema type.</li><li><strong>Improve documentation</strong> - added a vitepress static site generator for documentation, as well as a fully described public API of the library, with all examples and a detailed description of the use.</li></ul><p><strong>BREAKING CHANGE:</strong> defineOptions function deleted. Use .parse().</p><h2 id="v1-1-0" tabindex="-1">v1.1.0 <a class="header-anchor" href="#v1-1-0" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ul><li>Fixed the bug with async functions.</li><li>Add keys checker for a property schema settings.</li></ul><h2 id="v1-0-1" tabindex="-1">v1.0.1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#v1-0-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ul><li>Added metadata to the package.</li></ul><h2 id="v1-0-0" tabindex="-1">v1.0.0 <a class="header-anchor" href="#v1-0-0" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Initial release.</p>',11),n=[s];function r(d,l,h,c,p,g){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const m=e(o,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
